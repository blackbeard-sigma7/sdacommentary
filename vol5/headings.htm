The earliest manuscripts having the title of this gospel read, ―According to Luke.‖ Later manuscripts read, ―The Gospel According to Luke,‖ or, ―The Holy Gospel According to Luke.‖</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a214" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―common [language]‖ of the Greek-speaking Roman world.

This word may  imply that Theophilus had thus far received only oral instruction, such as might</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a218" style="padding-left: 70pt;">2 Chron. 8:14), of which the course of Abijah (or Abia) was the eighth (1 Chron. 24:10). Sixteen of the courses were made up of descendants of Eleazar, and eight, of descendants of Ithamar, both sons of Aaron. Only four of the courses were represented by the priests who returned from Babylon after the Captivity, and Abijah was not among these (see on Ezra 2:36). But those who did return were nevertheless divided into 21 or 22 courses (expanded to 24 in NT times), and were assigned the names of the original courses (see on Neh. 12:1). According to Josephus, each course of priests was expected to serve for a week, from Sabbath to Sabbath (Antiquities vii. 14. 7 [365, 366]), semiannually. At the Feast of Tabernacles all 24 courses were expected to be present. Attempts to determine the time of year at which the course of Abijah came up for service, based on the course serving at the time the Romans destroyed the Temple in A.D. 70, are apparently of little or no value as far as the dating of Luke‘s narrative is concerned.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a219" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Since all men ―have sinned, and come short of the glory of God‖ (Rom. 3:23; see also 1 John 3:4), all stand in need of someone to ―deliver‖ them from death, the penalty of disobedience (Rom. 6:23; 7:24). The Deliverer is none other than Christ Jesus (chs. 7:25 to 8:4). But until the Saviour came into the world, God ordained a system of sacrifices</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a220" style="padding-left: 70pt;">His lot was. Gr. lagchanō, ―to obtain by lot.‖ Owing to the large number of priests, not all might officiate at any given service.

The term is used in Heb. 8:6 and 9:21 of the ―ministry‖ of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a225" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Nazareth. An obscure Galilean town not mentioned in the OT or the Talmud, or included by Josephus in a list of 204 towns of Galilee (see on Matt. 2:23). The childhood and youth of Jesus, the period on which the Scriptures are comparatively silent, were spent in a locality concerning which historical records are largely silent. Here, in a small community, Jesus was free from the rabbinical influence of larger Jewish centers, and also from pagan Greek culture that pervaded ―Galilee of the Gentiles‖ (Matt. 4:15). The common attitude of the Jews toward Nazareth is reflected in the retort of Nathanael to Philip: ―Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?‖ (John 1:46), and of the Pharisees to Nicodemus, ―Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet‖ (John 7:52). See illustration facing p. 512.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a226" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―troubled,‖ Mary endeavored to think things through and to discover the reason for this unusual experience. Under such circumstances many people would probably lose, for the moment, the capacity for deliberative thought. Mary seems to have been not only a virtuous and devout maiden but one of remarkable intelligence as well. Not only had she an unusual acquaintance with the Scriptures, but she also reflected upon the meaning of the various experiences that life brought her (see ch. 2:19, 51). Unlike Zacharias, who became afraid (ch. 1:12), Mary seems to have kept her presence of mind.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a227" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―rejoice‖ (see on v. 28), a favorite word of early Christians. God was delighted to find in Mary one who approached so closely to the divine ideal.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a228" style="padding-left: 70pt;">He shall be great. There is a striking similarity between verses 32, 33 and Isa. 9:6, 7; one is a clear reflection of the other. Six months earlier Gabriel had told Zacharias that John would be ―great‖ (Luke 1:15).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a229" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―power,‖ in the sense of ―authority.‖ Dunamis is commonly used in the Gospels to refer to the miracles of Christ (Matt. 11:20–23; Mark 9:39; etc.). Here, the ―power of the Highest‖ is parallel to ―the Holy Ghost,‖ not meaning, however, that the Holy Ghost is</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a230" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Nothing shall be impossible. The thought of this verse is expressed repeatedly throughout the Scriptures. To Abraham came the question, ―Is any thing too hard for the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a231" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The hill country. See on v. 23. The mountainous uplands of Judah extended from Jerusalem in the north to Hebron in the south (see Joshua 21:11).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a232" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―Blessed art thou‖ is an expression based on OT usage (see Judges 5:24; Ruth 3:10).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a233" style="padding-left: 70pt;">moral understanding. Dianoia refers to the faculty of thought, especially to moral understanding.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a234" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―dynasty.‖ Dunastai is from dunamai, ―to be able,‖ ―to be powerful,‖ whence our word</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a235" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Them of low degree. Gr. tapeinoi, ―lowly [ones],‖ or ―humble [ones]‖; the Greek adjective form of the noun translated ―low estate‖ (see on v. 48). In due time God metes out justice to those who have been oppressed.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a236" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Mary abode. It is possible that Mary remained with Elisabeth till after the birth of John, though Luke‘s narrative seems to imply that she left prior to that time. It would seem out of character for Mary to leave at the very time Elisabeth would be most in need of her sympathetic and tender ministry. It is probable that Luke here mentions Mary‘s departure at this point in order to complete that portion of the narrative dealing with the visit of Mary to Elisabeth. Another instance of this literary device, common throughout both OT and NT, occurs in ch. 3:20, 21, where the imprisonment of John is introduced into the record before the baptism of Jesus, though it actually occurred afterward. The fact that Mary is not mentioned by name in ch. 1:57, 58 in no way implies that she did not participate in the incident here related.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a237" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―congratulated her,‖ which her friends and kinsfolk no doubt did; but Luke‘s statement here is not so much concerned with congratulations as with a genuine feeling of understanding on the part of the friends of Elisabeth (cf. Luke 15:6, 9; 1 Cor. 12:26).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a238" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Hand of the Lord. Here used figuratively of divine providence. In the NT this expression is peculiar to Luke (see Acts 11:21; 13:11), though it occurs commonly in the OT (Judges 2:15; 1 Kings 18:46, etc.). However, other NT writers use the expression</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a239" style="padding-left: 70pt;">His holy prophets. The prophets of old all bore witness to Christ (see Luke 24:25, 27, 44; John 5:39; Acts 3:21), and ―enquired and searched diligently‖ to understand what</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a240" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a241" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The house and lineage. Though here the statement applies exclusively to Joseph, it is clear that Mary also was of the ―house and lineage‖ of David (see on Matt. 1:16, 18;  Luke 1:27; cf. DA 44).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a242" style="padding-left: 70pt;">that small but faithful number who waited ―for the consolation of Israel‖ (v. 25) and</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a243" style="padding-left: 70pt;">natural on an occasion when the veil between men and the invisible world is parted. In OT times people to whom angels appeared, sometimes thought of the angel as a harbinger of death (Judges 6:22, 13:21, 22). This angel came to announce deliverance and joy (see Luke 2:10).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a244" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Bring … good tidings. Gr. euaggaelizō, ―to proclaim good news,‖ or ―to announce glad tidings.‖ Our words ―evangelist,‖ ―evangelize,‖ and ―evangelism‖ are derived from this Greek word. It is in this sense that the gospel writers are ―evangelists.‖ From its very</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a245" style="padding-left: 70pt;">clothes‖ (vs. 7, 12), the child of Mary was nonetheless ―Christ the Lord‖ (cf. Heb. 1:6). The title identifies Christ with ―the Lord‖ of OT times (see PP 366; DA 52; see on Luke 1:76), and would be equivalent to the expression Messiah Jehovah (see on Matt. 1:1; see Vol. I, p. 172).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a246" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Suddenly. An innumerable throng of angels had gathered above the hills of Bethlehem, awaiting the angelic announcement of the birth of the Saviour.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a247" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Let us now go. There was no doubt left in the minds of the shepherds as to the truth of the message of Gabriel. They acted at once. Contrast their belief with the hesitancy of Zacharias (see on ch. 1:18, 20).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a248" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Circumcising. To Abraham ―the sign of circumcision‖ was ―a seal‖ of the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a249" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Turtledoves. A species of pigeon. Had Joseph and Mary been in more prosperous circumstances, they would have brought a lamb for a burnt offering (see Lev. 12:6). Instead, they brought the offering of the poor, one bird being for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering (see Lev. 12:8; see on Lev. 1:14; 5:7).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a250" style="padding-left: 70pt;">All people. Literally, ―all peoples.‖ Luke again takes note of the universal appeal of the gospel message (see Vol. IV, pp. 28-30).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a251" style="padding-left: 70pt;">To lighten.

According to the apocryphal gospels and a tradition later adopted by the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a253" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―under the law‖ (Galatians 4:4), a Jew, and therefore fulfilled all requirements of the ―law of the Lord,‖ as the Levitical laws pertaining to purification and presentation (Luke 2:22–</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a254" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The child grew. This passage covers the childhood of Jesus, till He was 12 years of age (v. 42), as vs. 51, 52 cover His youth and young manhood. The development of the human nature and personality of Jesus Christ proceeded apace in a normal way, except that He never once yielded to sin. He lived as a normal child and youth would live, in the family circle. He passed through these years as every human being does, so far as physical, mental, spiritual, and social growth are concerned (see on v. 52), except that no flaws marred the process of growth. This growth process clearly attests the true humanity of Jesus, as its perfection attests His divinity.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a255" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Jesus tarried. Christ‘s obedient nature, even as a child, gave Joseph and Mary every reason for confidence in Him; His ―bright, receptive mind,‖ marked by ―thoughtfulness and wisdom beyond His years‖ (DA 68, 69), made His obedience not blind but intelligent. Even as a child, Jesus was ever attentive to, and anticipated the wants of, his parents (DA 80). He always seemed to know what to do, and was faithful in doing it; and on this occasion Mary and Joseph took for granted that He would do as He had done in the past.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a256" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Supposing. Jesus had never given His parents a valid reason for anxiety. They presumed that He was acquainted with their plans to return with ―the company,‖ and that He knew the proposed time for departure.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a257" style="padding-left: 70pt;">with,‖ and hodos, ―a road,‖ or ―a way.‖ For companionship and protection, those attending the various annual feasts at Jerusalem customarily traveled in large groups. Often all of those going from a village or town would plan to travel together in a caravan.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a258" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Thy father and I. For the last time in the entire gospel narrative Joseph is spoken of as the ―father‖ of Jesus. Now that Jesus was aware of His relationship to His heavenly Father, it is appropriate that His earthly ―father‖ should fade from the gospel picture (see on v. 51). The silence of the Scriptures concerning Joseph from this time forth suggests that he did not live to see the opening of Christ‘s public ministry (see DA 145). For reference to Joseph as the ―father‖ of Jesus, see on v. 33.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a259" style="padding-left: 70pt;">development of His physical, mental, and spiritual powers (see Ed 13). The goal toward which He aspired was to reflect perfectly the character of His Father in heaven. Here was perfect humanity, restored to the image of God. Thirty years of constant preparation preceded a brief ministry of 3 1/2 years. The statement of v. 40 refers particularly to the childhood of Jesus, and that of v. 52 primarily to His youth and young manhood. Similar statements are made concerning the youth of Samuel (1 Sam. 2:26) and that of John the Baptist (Luke 1:80).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a260" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Every valley. That is, every chasm or ravine, every rough place in the road. Luke alone of the gospel writers adds the details of vs. 5, 6, quoted from Isa. 40:4, 5. The work here described is an apt illustration of the transformation of character that accompanies genuine conversion. The high places of human pride and power were to be cast down (DA 215; see on Matt. 3:3).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a261" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Generation.

In the Greek ―we‖ is emphatic, as if the soldiers had said: ―And we, what shall we do?‖ This emphasis may imply that the soldiers were in the company of the tax collectors, who had just spoken to John (vs. 12, 13).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a267" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Many other things. This implies that the items mentioned constitute a summary of the preaching of John the Baptist rather than a verbatim report of any one sermon (see on v. 7).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a268" style="padding-left: 70pt;">My beloved Son. See on Matt. 3:17. Codex Bezae adds, ―today I have begotten thee.‖ While here affirming the true deity of Jesus, Luke proceeds at once to prove His true humanity (vs. 23–38). Matthew opens his account of the gospel story by presenting the genealogy of Jesus (see on Matt. 1:1); Luke reserves his genealogy for the moment when Jesus took up His life mission. Moses similarly gives his own pedigree after recording his first public appearance as spokesman for God and leader of Israel (see Ex. 6:16–20).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a269" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Sem.

Satan implied that Adam had chosen him as his sovereign and representative in heaven. The emphasis here given in the Greek to the pronouns by their position is revealing: ―To thee will I give … for to me it hath been delivered … Thou, therefore, if thou wilt worship me,‖ etc. One can almost see Satan‘s emphatic gestures as he makes this proposal.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a275" style="padding-left: 70pt;">For a season. That is, until a convenient time, when another opportunity might present itself. From earliest years Christ was continually assailed by the tempter (DA 71, 116).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a276" style="padding-left: 70pt;">His custom. Literally, ―according to what was customary to him.‖ Christ was in the habit of attending the regular synagogue services on the Sabbath day. Often as a youth in this very synagogue at Nazareth He had been called upon to read the lesson from the prophets, and from His intimate knowledge of the Scriptures He had drawn forth lessons that thrilled the hearts of the worshipers (DA 74; cf. 70). It seems that Jesus often made use of the opportunity afforded by the assembling of the people at the synagogues of Judea and Galilee, to teach them (see Matt. 4:23; 12:9; 13:54; Mark 1:21; 6:2; John 18:20; etc.; see on Luke 4:15), even as Paul later did in foreign lands (Acts 13:14, 15, 42).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a277" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The poor. The poor were usually at the mercy of unscrupulous officials, businessmen, and neighbors. Further, it was generally supposed that the suffering of poverty was due to the curse of God—that their unfortunate state was their own fault. Few felt sympathetic toward them in their unhappy plight. Jesus‘ marked love for the poor was one of the great evidences of His Messiahship to which He called the attention of John the Baptist when the latter was languishing in prison (see Matt. 11:5). Those who have little of this world‘s goods are frequently conscious of their needs and of their reliance upon God, and thus frequently susceptible to the preaching of the gospel. The gospel of Jesus means relief for the poor, light for the ignorant, alleviation of distress for the suffering, and emancipation for the slaves of sin.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a278" style="padding-left: 70pt;">hands, ―a servant.‖ Here Luke doubtless refers to the chazzan, or deacon, who returned the scroll to the ark (see on v. 17).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a279" style="padding-left: 70pt;">James 5:17).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a280" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Many lepers. Jesus provides a further illumination of the proverb quoted in v. 23. For the narrative of the healing of Naaman see 2 Kings 5:1–19. Some of the ―many lepers</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a281" style="padding-left: 70pt;">When they heard. The people of Nazareth were not slow to see the application of the words Jesus had spoken. They saw clearly the point He was making. Possibly there flashed before their memory some incidents from the Saviour‘s childhood and youth when Jesus‘ loyalty to right had silently condemned their own wrong course of action (DA 89); now the Lord‘s implied rebuke fell heavily upon their reluctant hearts. Momentarily conscious of their own defective characters and of their need for true repentance and conversion, their evil hearts rose in revolt (see Rom. 8:7). Pride and prejudice darkened their unwilling minds to the light of truth that had momentarily penetrated their dim souls.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a282" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Passing through. Angels shut Him in and conducted Him to a place of safety, as they did again on another occasion (cf. John 8:59), and as they have often protected Heaven‘s witnesses in all ages (see DA 240).

From the viewpoint of the Pharisees there was no difference between them. A ―publican‖ was automatically a ―sinner‖ simply by virtue of the fact that he was a tax collector (see on ch. 3:12).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a301" style="padding-left: 70pt;">36. No man putteth. Important textual evidence may be cited (cf. p. 146) for adding the word ―teareth,‖ to make the statement read: ―No man teareth a piece from a new garment and putteth [it] upon an old.‖</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a302" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The old is better. Textual evidence is divided (cf. p. 146) between this and the reading ―The old is good,‖ that is, the old is mild or pleasant. One who is accustomed to the old wine considers it more mellow, in comparison with the new, and therefore more pleasing. Christ says that a person used to old wine finds that it is pleasant to his taste; it suits him well, and that is enough. He will not change his old habits. This parable illustrates the deep-grained prejudice of the Pharisees.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a303" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―second-first Sabbath.‖ The precise meaning of the expression thus translated is uncertain. Textual evidence favors (cf. p. 146) reading simply ―a Sabbath.‖ Some translators feel that the weight of evidence favors the shorter reading, while others hold to</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a304" style="padding-left: 70pt;">nous, ―mind‖; hence, ―senseless rage.‖ These men were ―out of their heads.‖ From the point of view of the Pharisees this was at least the fifth offense of Jesus against rabbinical law since the beginning of His Galilean ministry (see on Mark 2:24). His enemies were</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a305" style="padding-left: 70pt;">To pray. Luke seems to have been particularly impressed with the prayer life of Jesus, and makes reference to it more often than do the other gospel writers. For a discussion of the prayer life of Jesus see on Mark 3:13.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a306" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Virtue. Gr. dunamis, ―power‖ (see on ch. 1:35). The accompanying verb translated</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a307" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Blessed. Luke records four of the eight beatitudes given by Matthew. For a comparison of the two series of beatitudes, see on Matt. 5:3. In addition to four blessings, Luke gives four comparable woes (see Luke 6:24–26).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a308" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Cast out your name. That is, throw it away contemptuously. This refers to the circulation of false and malicious reports (see 1 Peter 4:14).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a309" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Woe unto you. The contrast of blessing and woe seems to have been a characteristic Jewish literary device, and originated, probably, with the blessings and the curses of Deuteronomy (chs. 27 and 28). Compare also Christ‘s woes upon the scribes and the Pharisees (see Matt. 23).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a310" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Give to every man. The tense of the Greek verbs translated ―give,‖ ―taketh away,‖ and ―ask‖ expresses repeated or habitual action. The admonition to ―give to every man that asketh‖ does not mean to give him everything he asks for, nor does it require one to give something every time he is asked. As the verb form makes clear, and as the general tenor of the entire Sermon on the Mount makes evident, Christ means that giving should become habitual with us. Christ‘s admonition does not mean that a Christian is obliged to give indiscriminately, irrespective of need. He will, rather, have a generous spirit that is ready and glad to give—according to the need represented by the request and his own ability to meet that need (see on Matt. 5:42). A Christian will, as a rule, respond favorably to requests that come to him for help. He will not, as is the custom of men with unregenerate hearts, be unwilling to give or refuse to give. He will be disposed to cooperate with others rather than to oppose them.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a311" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Sinners. According to the Jews, a ―sinner‖ was one who either did not know the law at all or who knew it but would not obey it. All Gentiles were thus sinners, along with those among the Jews who became tax collectors, harlots, etc.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a312" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Lend to them.

This lending refers to business transactions in which money is lent on interest.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a313" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Hoping. Gr. apelpizō, a word occurring nowhere else in the NT. In Greek literature it always means ―to despair,‖ or ―to give up in despair.‖ There is some textual evidence (cf.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a314" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―children of your Father‖ of Matt. 5:45. The Hebrew equivalent of Hupsistos is ‘Elyon</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a315" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Bosom. Gr. kolpos. Either the breast, or the fold made in the wide, outer garment by tucking it into the girdle, thus making a hollow or pocket (see Ex. 4:6; Ps. 79:12; Prov. 6:27; Jer. 32:18; see on Ps. 65:6).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a316" style="padding-left: 70pt;">He spake a parable. This is generally considered to mark the beginning of the second section of the Sermon on the Mount as recorded by Luke. Sixteen of the illustrations used in this sermon, as told by Matthew and Luke, may be classed as</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a317" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The disciple. That is, the learner is not above the teacher. This is similar to our proverb about a stream not rising higher than its source. The Chinese have a proverb to the effect that ―a student cannot excel his teacher.‖ In its contextual relationship to v. 39, the proverb about the student and his teacher equates the ―master‖ with the blind man who attempts to lead, or instruct, another blind man, and the ―disciple‖ with the one being led. The moral is simply that those who would pose as teachers of others must have clear insight into the matters concerning which they propose to give instruction. Unless they do, those they teach can at best reach a low standard.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a318" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Perceivest.

Rather, ―fell together,‖ or ―collapsed‖ (see on Matt. 7:27).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a321" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―after.‖ The events of vs. 1–10 followed the Sermon on the Mount in close chronological sequence (see on Matt. 8:2), and may have occurred on the same day. Luke 7:1 provides the transition from the place where the Sermon on the Mount was given to that where the centurion‘s servant was healed. For other instances of sequence transition in Luke see chs. 4:30, 37, 44; 5:11, 16, 26; 6:11; etc. It was now probably the late summer of A.D. 29 (see MB 2, 45; see on Matt. 5:1), and the time of day, perhaps late afternoon.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a322" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Dear. Gr. entimos, ―in honor,‖ ―honored,‖ or ―prized.‖ In ch. 14:8 entimos is translated ―honourable,‖ in Phil. 2:29, ―in reputation,‖ and in 1 Peter 2:4, 6, ―precious.‖ Entimos appears in the papyri in reference to soldiers of long and distinguished service.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a323" style="padding-left: 70pt;">When he heard. The centurion‘s knowledge of Jesus was limited to the reports that had reached him of the Saviour‘s great deeds. He had never seen Jesus previous to the present occasion (DA 315).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a324" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Heal. Gr. diasōzo, ―to bring safely through,‖ ―to save.‖ The centurion wanted Jesus to bring his faithful slave safely through his illness.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a325" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Worthy. See on vs. 4, 6. Perhaps the conscientious scruples with respect to what the centurion mistakenly thought to be the attitude of Jesus toward Gentiles (see on v. 4) had kept him from presuming upon the good will of Jesus, even so far as to appear before Him in person. However, he did come to Jesus, and vs. 7, 8 represent what he said in person to the Lord (see DA 316).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a326" style="padding-left: 70pt;">omission of these words.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a327" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Glorified God. According to the Greek they continued to praise God. When the people recovered from fear their next thought was to praise God.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a328" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Evil spirits. It is important to note that Luke the physician carefully distinguishes between those who are demon possessed and those whose affliction is limited to the physical being. This fact precludes the possibility that he confused the two, as some have asserted (see vs. 6:17, 18; 7:2; 8:27–36; Additional Note on Mark 1).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a329" style="padding-left: 70pt;">All the people. Some consider vs. 29, 30 an inspired parenthetical comment by Luke rather than a part of Christ‘s discourse on John the Baptist. An interpolation of this length, however, would be most unusual for Luke. There is no reason why Christ might not have made the statement.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a330" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Justified. Gr. dikaioō, here meaning, ―to acknowledge God‘s righteousness.‖ The people ―justified God‖ by responding to the divine message through John the Baptist. They recognized that what John said was true, and that, as a prophet, he had the right to</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a331" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Lawyers. See on Mark 1:22; 2:16. These men were not ―lawyers‖ in the sense that we use the term today. They were students and expositors of Jewish law.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a332" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The Lord said. Textual evidence attests (cf. p. 146) the omission of these words. They appear in the Vulgate and in later Greek manuscripts. It has been suggested that the phrase was inserted to indicate the belief that vs. 29, 30 were not the words of Jesus, but an editorial comment by Luke (see on v. 29).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a333" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Desired. Jesus had cured Simon of the leprosy (Matt. 26:6; DA 557), and he, desiring to express his gratitude, prepared a feast and invited Jesus as the guest of honor. This feast took place in Bethany on the day preceding Christ‘s triumphal entry into Jerusalem (DA 557 cf. 569), less than one week prior to the crucifixion. Furthermore, Lazarus, who had been raised from the dead not more than two months previously, during the late winter of A.D. 30–31 (see on John 11:1), was included as a guest of honor along with</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a334" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Spake within himself. Simon was reclining next to Jesus, and would be one of the first persons at the table to detect the perfume and to notice what was happening. A gracious host, he said nothing. But he passed silent judgment on Jesus for permitting the act of gratitude without remonstrating with the woman.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a335" style="padding-left: 70pt;">A certain creditor. [The Two Debtors, Luke 7:41–43. See on parables pp. 203– 207.] That is, ―a certain [professional] lender [of money at interest].‖ This brief parable is concerned with gratitude for the blessings of salvation. Apparently the parable is based on the fundamental principle that one‘s appreciation for blessings received is in direct proportion to one‘s sense of need in respect to those blessings. Only he who comes to the place where he feels his utter helplessness before God is in a frame of mind properly to appreciate what God does for him, whether in material things or in spiritual things. He who does not sense his need of divine help is confident of his own ability and resources, and relies on these to find a solution to the problems that confront him. It is for this reason that God so often permits His earthborn children to exhaust their own resources before He steps in to provide them with divine help. Should He intervene before they become conscious of their utter helplessness, they would not truly appreciate the blessings bestowed, they would not be led to trust in His wisdom and kindness, their characters would remain imperfect, and they would continue to trust in their own devices and ability to cope with the problems of life.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a336" style="padding-left: 70pt;">I suppose. The answer was obvious, as was the case with so many of the parables and lessons of Jesus. In some instances those to whom they were addressed were reluctant, in other instances ready, to acknowledge the lesson so clearly set forth (Matt. 21:31, 41, 45; see Luke 10:36, 37).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a337" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Oil.

Some of their more important reasons for this conclusion are: (1) doubt that Mary of Bethany could have been of the character of the woman described by Luke, inasmuch as what is recorded elsewhere in the Gospels concerning Mary of Bethany seems to them to preclude identifying her with this woman; (2) doubt that a Pharisee, particularly one living only 2 mi. from Jerusalem, would, less than a week prior to the crucifixion, entertain Jesus publicly, particularly when there was evidently a question in his own mind as to the Messiahship of Jesus; (3) seemingly irreconcilable differences between the account in Luke and that of the other three Gospels which, in their opinion, tend to outweigh the many points of similarity.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a342" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a343" style="padding-left: 70pt;">narrative of ch. 7:36–50 as preceding what he is now about to relate, but to his account of</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a344" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―from city to city and from village to village.‖ There is no word for ―every‖ in the Greek. There were more than 200 cities, towns, and villages in Galilee, and it would have been difficult if not impossible even briefly to visit them all during the few weeks devoted to this missionary itinerary.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a345" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The kingdom of God. See on Matt. 3:2; 4:17. During the early part of His Galilean ministry Jesus had proclaimed, ―The kingdom of heaven is at hand‖ (see Matt. 4:17; Mark 1:15). But between the first and second tours He had formally established His kingdom (see on Matt. 5:1; Mark 3:13). Now He went forth to proclaim the establishment of the kingdom and to demonstrate its benefits for man (see on Luke 7:11).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a346" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Evil spirits. At least Mary Magdalene, and perhaps others, had been set free from demons.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a347" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Mary called Magdalene. See Additional Note on Chapter 7. The synoptic narratives always mention Mary Magdalene first when her name is listed together with the names of other women (see Matt. 27:56, 61; 28:1; Mark 15:40, 47; 16:1; Luke 24:10). This testifies to her ardent devotion to Jesus. Her gratitude was not merely emotional (see on Luke 7:38, 44), but intensely practical. This Mary is called Magdalene in order to distinguish her from the other Marys, of whom there were several. The name Mary occurs frequently in the NT. It is derived from the Hebrew name translated ―Miriam‖ in the OT (see on Matt. 1:16). The designation Magdalene probably indicates that Mary was living in the town of Magdala (see on Matt. 15:39) at the time Christ found her and set her free from the power of demons.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a348" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Lighted a candle. See on Matt. 5:14–16. Only Mark and Luke record this parable as part of the Sermon by the Sea (Luke 8:4–18; see Mark 4:1–34). Possibly the reason Matthew did not include it is that he had already referred to Christ‘s use of the same theme as part of the Sermon on the Mount (see Matt. 5:14–16), though the application was different there. Later, Luke repeats a parable by Christ, essentially the same (see ch. 11:33), with an application different from either of the two former presentations of the theme. Certain lessons here recorded by Luke were also repeated by Christ upon other occasions (see on ch. 8:17, 18).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a349" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Whosoever hath. See on Matt. 13:12; see also Matt. 25:29; Mark 4:25; Luke 6:38; 19:26. The truth here stated Christ spoke on numerous occasions, early and late during the course of His ministry.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a350" style="padding-left: 70pt;">worthy of note that two of the three instances of Luke‘s use of monogenēs have to do with cases of raising from the dead—that of the son of the widow of Nain (see on Luke 7:12), and that of Jairus‘ daughter recorded here. The third instance of monogenēs in Luke is in connection with the healing of the lunatic son (see ch. 9:38). In the mind of an</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a351" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Desired to see. Literally, ―was seeking to see.‖ It was more than a desire on the part of Herod; he was actually looking for an appropriate opportunity to have an interview with Jesus without, as he felt, compromising the dignity of his position as king. Herod seems to have had such interviews with John the Baptist (see DA 214, 222, 223), and apparently saw no reason why he should not have an interview with Jesus. But, like Nicodemus (see DA 168), Herod felt that it would be humiliating to one in his high position to go to Jesus openly. It might appear that he was taking Jesus‘ claims seriously and was seeking counsel of Him. Herod well knew how Herodias would react to such an interview. Eventually Herod did have an opportunity to see Jesus face to face (see ch.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a352" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Wear away. Gr. klinō, ―to bend,‖ ―to bow [down],‖ or ―to incline oneself‖ (see on Mark 2:15). Such English words as ―decline,‖ ―incline,‖ ―recline,‖ and ―clinic‖ are derived from klinō.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a353" style="padding-left: 70pt;">sometimes described as Luke‘s ―great omission.‖ Luke here omits all that is recorded in Matt. 14:22 to 16:12; Mark 6:45 to 8:26; and John 6:25 to 7:1; namely, Jesus walking on the lake, the Sermon on the Bread of Life, arguments with the Pharisees, the retirement to Phoenicia, the healing of the deaf-mute, the feeding of the 4,000, and the healing of the blind man at Bethsaida. As if to balance this ―great omission‖ Luke has what is sometimes called the ―great insertion,‖ which consists of chs. 9:51 to 18:14, almost none of which appears in any of the other Gospels (see on ch. 9:51).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a354" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Major comment: Matthew.] For counting the ―eight days‖ see pp. 248-250.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a355" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Decease.

Not because Jesus willed that it should be, for upon repeated occasions He endeavored to make the matter clear. It was hid, rather, because of their own refusal to understand (see on Mark 9:32).

The other writers are almost entirely silent concerning this phase of Jesus‘ ministry (see on ch. 9:18).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a359" style="padding-left: 70pt;">cf. Luke 24:50, 51).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a360" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The labourer. See on Matt. 10:10; cf. Deut. 25:4.

The disciples were not to be greedy, asking for food their host did not provide; or fastidious, declining to eat what he did provide. Jesus‘ admonition here given to the Seventy is sometimes construed as permission for Christians today to eat whatever may be provided by a host, even though it be food specifically forbidden in the Scriptures. It should be remembered, however, that the Seventy did not enter Gentile homes, where forbidden food would be served, but only the homes of Jews and Samaritans, both of which held rigorously to the provisions of the Pentateuch with respect to clean and unclean foods (see on Lev. 11).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a362" style="padding-left: 70pt;">With joy.

It was the lawyer‘s business to know the answer to his own question. He was a professor of Jewish law, and as such it was entirely appropriate that he should be given the opportunity to answer.

John 4:18–20) and is casting about for some reason or excuse for not doing what conscience tells him he should do.

This man who addressed Jesus had heard the Lord‘s stern denunciations against the scribes and Pharisees (see ch. 11:39–52; COL 253) and His counsel to the disciples about appearing before magistrates (see ch. 12:11; cf. COL 252). He reasoned that if Jesus should speak to his brother with the same bold authority, he would not dare to do otherwise than what Jesus told him to do. He conceived of the gospel of the kingdom as nothing more than a means for furthering his own selfish interests.

Here for the first time Jesus teaches publicly concerning His second coming. The close of His earthly ministry is already in sight.

It seems to have been fairly common among the Jews of Christ‘s time to entertain on the Sabbath. The food was, no doubt, prepared the day before and kept</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a412" style="padding-left: 70pt;">11:54), watching with evil intent (see on ch. 6:7). Whether the spies had arranged for the man with ―dropsy‖ to be present, we do not know. But they had observed in times past that Jesus did not hesitate to heal a man on the Sabbath, in contravention of their legal tradition, and probably they presumed that He would again do so. Altogether seven instances of the healing of individuals on the Sabbath are reported in the gospel narratives, this being the seventh and the last in point of time (see Luke 4:33–36, 39; 6:6– 10; 13:10–17; 14:2–4; John 5:5–10; 9:1–14).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a413" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―water,‖ and descriptive of the condition of one who has a surplus of fluid in the body tissues. The word occurs only here in Biblical Greek. This is the only recorded example of such a case coming to the attention of Jesus. He may have come of his own volition, in the hope of being healed, though the record does not state that he presented himself before Jesus for healing. It is conceivable, as some have suggested, that certain of the Pharisees present had arranged for the sick man to be there, in order to trap Jesus into healing him on the Sabbath. The healing apparently took place prior to the time that those invited actually sat down at the table (see v. 7).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a414" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Let … go. Gr. apoluō, ―to set free,‖ ―to release,‖ ―to let go,‖ or ―to dismiss.‖ This seems to have been before the beginning of the meal (see v. 7). Perhaps Jesus sought to save the man from embarrassment and perplexity such as the Jewish leaders had recently</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a415" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Lowest room. That is, the lowest reclining place. All intervening places would, presumably, be taken by now, and no other place remained.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a416" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Worship. That is, ―honor,‖ an archaic meaning of the word ―worship.‖</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a417" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Call not thy friends. According to the Greek the thought may be summed up, ―Do not be in the habit of always inviting only your friends.‖ Jesus does not exclude the entertainment of friends, but rather warns against the selfish motives that lead many to entertain only those from whom they expect similar courtesies. Jesus encourages hospitality on the basis of genuine interest in the needs of our fellow men—perhaps the need for food, perhaps the need for friendship. He points out that this kind of hospitality, though not returned in the present life, will be rewarded in the life to come.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a418" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Of the just. Mention of ―the resurrection of the just‖ implies a similar resurrection of the ―unjust‖ (see John 5:29; Acts 24:15).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a419" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―servant‖ sent to proclaim that ―all things are now ready.‖ In Oriental lands even today it is customary to dispatch a messenger a short time before the feast actually begins to remind the guests of their invitation. In case a guest might have forgotten about the invitation, or might not know when he was expected to appear, this would allow him time to prepare for the occasion and to reach the place designated for the banquet. In the Orient, where less attention is paid to calendars and clocks than in Western lands, such a reminder is of practical value in that it avoids embarrassment to both the host and his guests.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a420" style="padding-left: 70pt;">v. 16). Furthermore, when the servant first went out into the streets and lanes of the city, he was unable to find enough persons to fill the guestchamber (see v. 22).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a421" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Salvation consists of the invitation extended by God, and man‘s acceptance of it. Neither can be effective without the other. The Scriptures repeatedly present the possibility that those who have made light of the grace of God may seem to change their minds when it is too late, that is, when the gospel call no longer sounds (see Jer. 8:20; Matt. 25:11, 12; Luke 13:25). That call is finally withdrawn, not because any temporal limit to the mercy of God has been exceeded, but rather because those excluded have made a final, conclusive decision. If they later change their minds, that change is confined to a realization that they have made the wrong choice as far as results to themselves go, and does not mean that they have suddenly acquired a genuine desire to live in obedience to God.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a422" style="padding-left: 70pt;">So likewise. As usual, Jesus clearly states the lesson His parables are designed to teach. Discipleship involves the complete placing on the altar of all that a man has in this life—plans, ambitions, friends, relatives, possessions, riches—anything and everything that might interfere with service for the kingdom of heaven (cf. ch. 9:61, 62). Such was the experience of the apostle Paul (see Phil. 3:8–10).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a423" style="padding-left: 30pt;">ELLEN G.

Chapters 9:51 to 19:28 record events connected with the Peraean ministry (see on Luke 9:51; Matt. 19:1, 2), probably from the late autumn of A.D. 30 to the early spring of A.D. 31. Apparently at least the first two parables of ch. 15, and possibly the third as well, were given upon one occasion (COL 192) in the pasture lands of Peraea (COL 186). It was now about two months before the crucifixion (see on Matt. 19:1, 2; Luke 10:25; 11:37; 12:1). In these parables Jesus set forth the meaning of that event.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a426" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―murmured‖ (see on Luke 5:30; Matt. 20:11). Some were doubtless spies commissioned by the Sanhedrin to follow Jesus wherever He went, to listen and observe, and to report back (see DA 213; see on Luke 11:54). For the motives that led them to complain see COL 186; see on v. 1. It is a paradox that those who considered themselves paragons of righteousness felt so uncomfortable in the presence of Jesus, whereas those who admittedly made no claim to righteousness felt drawn to the Saviour (COL 186).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a427" style="padding-left: 70pt;">If he lose one of them. The loss of one might seem a comparatively small matter, but to the owner of the flock the loss of even one occasioned serious concern (cf. John 10:11). The Eastern shepherd commonly knew each sheep personally and cared for it not only as one of the flock but for its own sake. Not only so, but the loss of a single sheep would make an appreciable difference in his income. In the parable the fact that the sheep became lost was evidently due to its own ignorance and folly, and once lost it seemed completely helpless to find its way back. It realized that it was lost, but knew not what to do about it. The one lost sheep represents both the individual sinner and the one world that has been lost (COL 190). This parable teaches that Jesus would have died had there been but one sinner (see on John 3:16), as He did die for the one world that had sinned (see on Luke 15:7).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a428" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―desolate,‖ ―solitary,‖ or ―lonely.‖ The emphasis of the word is on an uninhabited region (see on ch. 1:80), hence, usually untilled or untillable land, a ―waste‖ Hence, however, reference is made to the usual pasturelands, the hills, upland valleys, and gullies of Peraea. This ―wilderness‖ was probably not a place of particular danger, and leaving the 99 sheep there does not imply any neglect or carelessness. In the parable as given by Matthew, the shepherd left the sheep, literally, ―in the hills‖ (see on ch. 18:12).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a429" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Rejoice with me. Joy that is shared with others is intensified in the heart of the person who shares it. Whoever has had the experience of finding again some article of value he feared irretrievably lost can understand the joy of this woman (cf. Rom. 12:15). But of all the joys earth has to offer, there is no joy like that of finding a lost sinner and bringing him to Jesus.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a430" style="padding-left: 70pt;">A certain man.

Though Inspiration has not indicated precisely when and where this parable was spoken, it is reasonable to think that it was given either at the same time as the two that precede it, or very shortly after.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a431" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―dissolutely,‖ or ―profligately,‖ is an adverb derived from a, a negative prefix, and soō or</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a432" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Filled his belly. Apparently he could not earn even enough to eat, and found himself reduced to the place where what the swine ate seemed desirable to him also. Thus, for the moment, his ambitions in life were no higher than those of the swine. In fact, his ambitions had been no higher during his riotous days, but he did not become aware of the fact until he was reduced to actual hunger.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a433" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Called thy son.

Compare the rejoicing of the shepherd over the one lost sheep as compared with that which he feels for the ones that had not strayed from the fold (see on vs. 4, 7). However, the father goes on to point out his equal love for the older son, even if there had been no occasion for showing it by means of a celebration.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a437" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―this thy son‖ (v. 30), the father uses an expression of tender entreaty, ―thy brother.‖ In the pleading of the father with the older boy, Jesus represents His own pleading with the scribes and the Pharisees. He loves them fully as well as He does the ―publicans and sinners‖ (vs. 1, 2). They need not take offense at His attitude toward these unfortunate outcasts of society. They need not fear for their own rights and privileges. But it is</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a438" style="padding-left: 30pt;">CHAPTER 16</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a439" style="padding-left: 70pt;">They.

His ―wisdom,‖ or</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a443" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―little.‖ Again it should be pointed out that Jesus did not commend the dishonesty of the steward (see on v. 8). Lest the disciples, or others in the audience, should seize upon this parable as providing, in any measure, an excuse for dishonesty, Jesus here clearly states the profound truth that all who would be His disciples must be characterized by</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a444" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The true riches. That is, spiritual ―riches‖ (see James 2:5). Compare Christ‘s admonition not to work for ―the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life‖ (John 6:27). A little earlier in His Peraean ministry Jesus warned men against laying up treasure for themselves instead of being ―rich toward God‖ (Luke 12:21).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a445" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Covetous. Gr. philarguroi, literally, ―money lovers.‖ The word occurs in the NT only here and in 2 Tim. 3:2. Some critical commentators have suggested that it was the Sadducees, not the Pharisees, as Luke has it, that are here described, on the basis that the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a446" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The law and the prophets. That is, the canonical writings of the OT (see Matt. 5:17; 7:12; 22:40; Luke 24:27, 44; Acts 13:15; 28:23; see on Luke 24:44).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a447" style="padding-left: 70pt;">on Matt. 5:18. As an illustration of the meaning of keraia, the part of the English letter</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a448" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Putteth away his wife. See on Matt. 5:27–32; cf. Matt. 19:9; 1 Cor. 7:10, 11. Adultery is still adultery even when men legalize it. Modern critics of the gospel record claim that in Luke 16:14–18 Luke has brought together a group unrelated sayings spoken by Jesus upon various occasions. But they fail to see the underlying thread of thought that makes of the entire chapter, in fact, a systematic and unified discourse. According to v. 15, the Pharisees and their teachings were held in abomination before God. This situation was not, however, because they had not had sufficient light; they had had ―the law and  the prophets‖ all the time (v. 16), and, more recently, the gospel. In v. 17 Jesus affirms the fundamental unity of His teachings with those of the OT, and in v. 18 He gives an illustration of the fact. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus had already used these same examples as evidence that His teachings did not cancel out those of the OT (see on Matt. 5:17–19, 27–32).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a449" style="padding-left: 70pt;">cowering or stooping like a beggar.‖ Sometimes ptōchos means simply ―poor,‖ or used as a noun, ―poor man‖ (see on Matt. 5:3).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a450" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Tip of his finger. Those who seek to find in this parable a support for the false doctrine of immortal, disembodied souls, find here embarrassment instead. As if disembodied spirits have ―fingers‖! Lazarus‘ body was in the grave, and therefore his fingers were also in the grave. It is incredible that one disembodied spirit should take a finger, which it is not supposed to have, dip it in water, and then touch the nonexistent tongue of another disembodied spirit. Obviously, Jesus is relating an imaginative story designed to make clear a certain particular truth concerning the relationship between this life and the next (see on v. 19), and does not intend His words to be taken literally. To the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a451" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Receivedst. He had received all the good things that anyone could wish in his lifetime, and had made no preparations for the future life. He had applied the principle of Matt. 6:33 in reverse—he had sought ―all these things‖ first and hoped that God would find some way of adding heaven later on. Compare the experience of the Rich Fool (see</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a452" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―gulf‖ represents the difference in moral character between the rich man and Lazarus (see COL 269). That it is ―fixed‖ emphasizes the fact that after death character cannot be changed. It is too late to change it (see Isa. 26:10). This chasm that barred the rich man from the bliss of ―Abraham‘s bosom‖ had been formed in the present life, by his own neglect to make proper use of opportunities then afforded for forming the right kind of character (see COL 271).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a453" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Though one rose. A few weeks after this our Lord raised Lazarus from the dead (see on John 11:1), as if to provide His carping critics with a fulfillment of the request expressed by the rich man of the parable. But, as Jesus has ―father Abraham‖ warn the rich man, most of the Jews still refused to believe. In fact, it was that very miracle that prompted them more definitely than in the past to plot His death (John 11:47–54).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a454" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Take heed. For comment on vs. 3, 4 see on Matt. 18:15–22. To fail to forgive others is one way of provoking them to rashness and to sin. Verses 1, 2 of Luke 17 are concerned with sin on our part against others, vs. 3, 4 with our attitude when others sin against us. We are to avoid causing others to stumble, and at the same time we are to be merciful to them when they cause us to stumble.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a455" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The apostles.

Neither tree should be confused with our sycamore.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a457" style="padding-left: 70pt;">difficult as to be absurd. It is evident that He did not intend His disciples to perform magic feats such as this. This illustration is similar to that of a camel going through the eye of a needle (see on Matt. 19:24). Both are difficult to the point of literal impossibility, and Jesus did not intend the disciples to contemplate doing either in a literal sense. None of His own miracles were of this sort.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a458" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Plowing. The master‘s home would probably be in the village or town, and his land not far away. Usually the ―servants‖ would leave town in the morning to work in the fields and return in the morning to work in the fields and return home in the evening (see on Num. 35:4; Ruth 2:3; 3:4; 4:1).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a459" style="padding-left: 70pt;">question (see on ch. 6:39).

Healing was conditional upon an act of faith. They were not healed so long as they lingered in Jesus‘ presence, but only as they proceeded to carry out His instructions. When they left Jesus they were still leprous. It is evident that had they awaited visible evidence of healing before setting out for Jerusalem, where they were to be pronounced ―clean,‖ healing would never have come. It was necessary for them to act in faith, as if they were already healed, before healing actually came. He who does not</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a463" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Glorified God. Realizing that divine power had released him from the bonds of his loathsome disease, ―one of them‖ made first things first—he praised God. This Samaritan stands out in the gospel record as a prime example of gratitude.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a464" style="padding-left: 70pt;">He was demanded of the Pharisees. [When and How the Kingdom Comes, Luke 17:20–37. Cf. on Matt. 24:3, 26–41.] Whether the Pharisees met Jesus during the course of this journey (see on v. 11), or after His arrival in Peraea, we do not know. It was now probably about the month of March, A.D. 31, at most a few weeks prior to the Passover. Compare also previous demands made by the Pharisees for information from John the Baptist (see John 1:19–22) and from Jesus (see Matt. 16:1; Mark 2:16; John 2:18).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a465" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Not see it.

The desert was frequently the congregating place of these political enthusiasts. In the intense longing of the disciples for the return of their Master, they were not to be deceived into thinking that any such upstart, military messiah might be the Christ.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a467" style="padding-left: 70pt;">They did eat. Literally, ―they were eating.‖ While the antediluvians carried on their normal round of activities, the Flood came and surprised them. They were not expecting so abrupt a change. They were engrossed in their worldly pursuits and pleasures, lulled to sleep by a false sense of security. They were not sufficiently concerned with what was coming (see on Gen. 6:5–13; cf. 2 Peter 2:5).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a468" style="padding-left: 70pt;">manifest.‖ Our word ―apocalypse‖ is derived from the noun form of apokaluptō. Here, the word refers to the revealing of the Son of man in power and glory, as the corresponding noun from (Gr. apokalupsis) sometimes does to the ―coming‖ of Jesus (see 1 Cor. 1:7; 2 Thess. 1:7; 1 PETER 1:17, 13).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a469" style="padding-left: 70pt;">His stuff.

Persistence in pressing her petition was the only weapon the widow had at her disposal. Her great need did not stir the judge‘s sense of justice or mercy (see on v. 3), but her persistence was effective in arousing his impatience. Instantly and with little effort on his part he could have ordered justice, but he did not do so until it became easier to dispense justice than to avoid doing so.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a472" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Cometh. This is one of our Lord‘s first direct references to His second coming, to which event He had already alluded briefly about six months prior to this time (see Matt. 16:27). The parable of the Tares, spoken approximately a year and a half before this time, refers to ―the Son of man‖ sending His angels to separate the tares from the wheat (see on Matt. 24:31), but does not refer directly to His coming back to this earth again (see Matt. 13:40–43; cf. Luke 17:22–30).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a473" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―robbers,‖ or ―extortioners‖ (see on Matt. 7:15; Luke 11:39). The Pharisee begins a recital of his negative virtues. These, he is confident, will endear him to God. He draws up an oral list of some sins of which he is not guilty. He is thankful for his own virtues rather than for God‘s righteousness and mercy. He is grateful that he has, by diligent effort, kept strictly within the letter of the law, but seems utterly oblivious of the spirit that must accompany true obedience in order to make it acceptable in God‘s sight.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a474" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Or even as this publican. The word ―this‖ is probably used here, not only to designate the publican, but also to express contempt concerning him (see on chs. 14:30; 15:2). ―This publican‖ was particularly conspicuous, because he could be seen ―standing afar off‖ from the crowd, in another direction (ch. 18:13). As the Pharisee‘s eye detects the presence of this social scapegrace, he prays, as it were, ―There, Lord, is a specimen of what I mean—that detestable tax collector. I rejoice that I am not a scoundrel as he is.‖</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a475" style="padding-left: 70pt;">31. We go up to Jerusalem. [Jesus Foretells His Death, Luke 18:31–34=Matt. 20:17– 19=Mark 10:32–42. Major comment: Matthew.] Though the incident here recorded is commonly known as Jesus‘ third announcement of His death, it is actually the sixth so far as the Gospel of Luke is concerned. The first two announcements came during the course of the six months of retirement following Jesus‘ public rejection in Galilee (see ch. 9:22, 44), between the Passover of A.D. 30 and the Feast of Tabernacles in the same year. Subsequently, during the course of Luke‘s extended account of the Peraean ministry (chs. 9:51 to 18:14), a phase of Christ‘s ministry not reported by any of the other gospel writers (see on ch. 9:51), Luke records three additional instances in which Jesus referred, at least indirectly, to His imminent sufferings and death (see chs. 12:50; 13:33; 17:25). These three additional occasions came during the six months following the Feast of Tabernacles of A.D. 30.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a476" style="padding-left: 70pt;">39. They which went before. Or, ―the ones who were in front.‖ This furnishes the possibility of an interesting side light on the formation of the group traveling with Jesus.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a477" style="padding-left: 70pt;">All the people. Luke here adds something that neither Matthew nor Mark mentions—the reaction of those who witnessed the miracle. In contrast with the Jewish leaders, who frequently attributed Jesus‘ power to the devil (see on Matt. 12:24), the common people, their perception not blinded by prejudice, attributed His power to God.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a478" style="padding-left: 70pt;">bearing the name Zakkai is mentioned in the OT (see Ezra 2:9; Neh. 7:14).

There were no doubt also in the throng many citizens of Jericho who had virtually been robbed by Zacchaeus or by his agents, and consequently considered him a thief.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a482" style="padding-left: 70pt;">That which was lost. See on Matt. 1:21. One might well expect here the phrase ―those who were lost,‖ meaning all sinners. But Jesus came to restore not only man but also all that had been lost by man‘s sin. The world itself will be brought once again to Edenic</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a483" style="padding-left: 70pt;">His ten servants. Or, ―ten servants of his.‖ The ―servants‖ here represent the disciples and all Christians, to whom Christ has entrusted His interests here on earth during His absence in the ―far country‖ (see on Matt. 16:19). There is no particular significance in the number ―ten,‖ which Jesus commonly used as a round number (see on Luke 15:8).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a484" style="padding-left: 70pt;">167). In the time of Christ the mna, ―pound,‖ was 11.46 oz. troy, or 356.4 g., 1/60 of a silver talent, worth 100 drachmas (p. 49; see on ch. 15:8). The purchasing value of that amount of silver would, of course, be far greater than today, for one mina was the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a485" style="padding-left: 70pt;">―napkin‖ was a sweatcloth or handkerchief of some kind used as part of the personal wardrobe.

Only the night before, the leaders of Israel had taken counsel together to kill Jesus. Judas then met with them for the first time, angered by the implied rebuke he had received at the home of Simon in Bethany (DA 558, 563, 564; see on Matt. 21:1). For vast multitudes to forsake the Temple service in favor of a glimpse of Jesus (DA 571), especially with the Passover season at hand, was an ominous portent of</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a489" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The days shall come. With divine foresight Jesus‘ eye pierces the future and sees the armies of Rome surrounding the city of Jerusalem and laying it desolate. He subsequently discussed briefly the future of Jerusalem with some of His disciples two days later on the western slope of the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3; see on Matt. 24:15– 20).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a490" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Trench.

Luke lists three of the charges preferred against Jesus by the Jewish authorities. Here, they charge Him with being a revolutionary agitator. Throughout His ministry Jesus had taken great care to avoid providing any valid basis for such a charge as the one now brought against Him (see on Matt. 14:22; 16:20; Mark 1:45; 6:42; John 6:15). This fabricated charge was directly related to the false Messianic concepts entertained by the Jewish leaders (see on Luke 4:19).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a537" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Sent him to Herod. Pilate was faced with a dilemma. He was fully convinced of Jesus‘ innocence and had publicly announced his decision to this effect. His own determination to release Jesus was exceeded only by the determination of the Jewish authorities to have the Saviour crucified. During Pilate‘s past tenure of about five years as procurator of Judea (which then included Samaria), he had made himself most unpopular with the Jews, and he feared that to displease them further would endanger his office. He knew well the treachery of some of the Jewish leaders. He knew also that their hatred of Jesus was due to malice alone. Pilate therefore must have felt that he was cutting the Gordian knot by sending Jesus to Herod, hoping thereby to maintain the good will of the Jewish authorities and at the same time evade responsibility for the death of one who was obviously innocent.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a538" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Set him at nought. Literally, ―counted him as nothing,‖ that is, they insulted Him. Like Pilate, Herod was satisfied that malice alone prompted the charges against Jesus, but the silence of Jesus irritated him, for it appeared that Jesus slighted his authority.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a539" style="padding-left: 70pt;">I sent you to him. Textual evidence favors (cf. p. 146) the reading ―he sent him back to us.‖ This seems to agree better with the context.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a540" style="padding-left: 70pt;">They cried.

Gr. hugros, ―damp,‖ ―moist,‖ or ―wet,‖ as applied to a tree, ―full of sap.‖ By a ―green‖ tree Jesus refers to Himself (DA 743).

Joseph and Nicodemus had not been summoned to the session of the Sanhedrin at which Jesus was tried and found guilty of blasphemy (DA 539, 699). The omission was deliberate. The vote to condemn Jesus was unanimous (see on Mark</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a553" style="padding-left: 70pt;">56. Rested the sabbath day. Luke specifically mentions Friday, the ―preparation‖ day (v. 54), the Sabbath day (vs. 54, 56), and the ―first day of the week‖ (ch. 24:1). There can be no question as to the sequence of these days or their identity. Christ was crucified on Friday, rested in the tomb over the Sabbath, having completed the work of redemption (see on Gen. 2:2, 3; Eze. 20:20), and rose the following day, the first day of the week (see on Luke 24:1).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a554" style="padding-left: 70pt;">connection is more clearly seen with an alternate translation: ―Indeed, they rested the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a555" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Joanna.

The distance by road would be about 8 mi. (12.8 km.) (see DA 795).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a557" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Are. Textual evidence favors (cf. p. 146) ending Christ‘s question with the words ―as ye walk,‖ and reading the last part of the verse: ―And they stood, [being, or, looking] sad.‖ According to this reading, the two disciples were so surprised at Jesus‘ apparent ignorance of events in Jerusalem that they halted, probably casting incredulous glances at their companion (see on v. 18).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a558" style="padding-left: 70pt;">We trusted. Literally, ―we were hoping.‖ The two disciples now express their own convictions. They had accepted Jesus as a prophet, and later came to believe in Him as more than a prophet. It had been a settled conviction with them, but their faith had been greatly shaken because they did not understand the Scriptures concerning the Messiah. They now imply that they must have been mistaken in their former belief. The  seriousness of their subsequent discussion, however, reveals that they had not entirely abandoned hope—especially in view of the astonishing reports of the women disciples who claimed to have seen Jesus (see vs. 22–24).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a559" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Of our company. Literally, ―of ours.‖ By this, the two disciples probably refer to all who had shared the ―hope‖ that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah of prophecy.</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a560" style="padding-left: 70pt;">All the scriptures. It was a vital point in the teachings of Jesus that ―all the scriptures‖ of the OT look forward to His Messianic work. For a summary of the way in which the OT writers were guided in the delineation of the life mission of the Messiah see on Matt. 1:22. Misguided men who deprecate the OT reveal little knowledge of the high esteem in which Christ held those sacred, inspired writings. Those who study and believe the OT, written by the hand of Moses and others, will find Christ therein (see on John 5:39, 46).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a561" style="padding-left: 70pt;">They knew him. Rather, ―they recognized him‖; that is, by the way He blessed and broke the bread and by the nailprints in His hands (see v. 35; DA 800).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a562" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Returned to Jerusalem. The sun had set before their arrival at Emmaus, and it was therefore after 6:30 P.M. (see on v. 29). Evening twilight was over by about 8:00. The two disciples probably set out for Jerusalem when it was nearly dark. Thus most of their journey was during the full darkness of night. Weary though they had been on the way home to Emmaus their weariness and hunger were now gone. As they entered Jerusalem by the east gate the dark and silent city was dimly lighted by the rising moon (see DA 802).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a563" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Did eat. Undoubtedly to convince the disciples that He was still a material, corporeal being. Some textual evidence may be cited (cf. p. 146) for adding, ―and the things left over he gave to them.‖</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a564" style="padding-left: 70pt;">The law of Moses. That is, the portion of the OT written by Moses, commonly called the Pentateuch, and consisting of the first five books of the Bible. Elsewhere the Pentateuch is referred to as ―the law‖ (Matt. 7:12; Luke 16:16; etc.), ―the law of Moses‖ (Acts 28:23), and sometimes simply ―Moses‖ (Luke 16:29, 31).</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a565" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Then opened he. How often in the past Jesus had sought to do so, but without success (see on ch. 18:34!)</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a566" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Beginning at Jerusalem. Jesus had begun His work in Jerusalem and in Judea (see on Matt. 4:17), and the disciples were to do the same. Here many of the greatest evidences of His divinity had been given. Jesus had worked first in Judea in order to provide the leaders of the nation with an opportunity to observe His teachings and His ministry, to accept Him as the Messiah, and to unite their efforts with His in the proclamation of the</a><a target="content" href="content.htm#a567" style="padding-left: 70pt;">Power. Gr. dunamis, ―ability to perform.‖ This ―power‖ would enable them to be effective ―witnesses‖ (see on v. 48). Without ―power from on high‖ the testimony borne by the disciples would not convince and convict men‘s hearts.
